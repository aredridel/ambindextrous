`ambindextrous` is a directory-index script (implemented using ruby-fcgi) that
has some nice usability tweaks over the stock apache one, and supports
descriptions as extended attributes on files if available.

It thumbnails jpeg files while retaining a 'directory index' format, which is
somewhat unique.
